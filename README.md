# Introduction

## History
This started out as a collection of interview questions and solutions I've accumulated over the years in Evernote. I've shared it with a few friends in the past. They found it quite valuable and scored some amazing jobs, heck one of them gifted me a bottle of wine when he got his offer!

## Its free!
That led me to believe there is value in open sourcing this stuff. I make no promises of you cracking your interview, but I am almost certain this should inspire you enough to create your own collection of notes and in the process build skills to crack that interview.

## Sources
I've scoured through several forums like careercup and glassdoor. While they're an excellent source for questions, finding good solutions/explanations is a PITA.

## Organization
Each post has 5 sections: problem statement, examples, algorithm, code (ruby), test cases(rspec) and a discussion on time-complexity.

In addition to standard topics like algorithms, data structures and puzzles, I've also added a system design section which focuses on a broad range of topics, like scaling, sharding, designing clones of existing services etc.
