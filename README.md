# Introduction

## History
This started out as a collection of interview questions and solutions that I accumulated over the years. I've shared it with close friends in the past and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

## Sources
I've scoured through several forums like Careercup and Glassdoor. While they're an excellent source for questions, finding good solutions with explanations is quite hard. Hence I decided to start preparing my own solutions and sharing it with others.

## Organization
Each post has 5 sections: problem statement, examples, algorithm, code, test cases and a discussion on time-complexity.

## Share
Hope you find this book useful and share it with others.
