# Introduction

## History
This started out as a collection of interview questions and solutions I've accumulated over the years in Evernote. I've shared it with a few friends in the past and the feedback was really positive.

## Sources
I've scoured through several forums like careercup and glassdoor. While they're an excellent source for questions, finding good solutions with explanations is quite hard. Hence I decided to start preparing my own solutions and sharing it with others.

## Organization
Each post has 5 sections: problem statement, examples, algorithm, code, test cases and a discussion on time-complexity.

In addition to standard topics like algorithms, data structures and puzzles, I've also added a system design section that focuses on a broad range of topics like scaling, sharding, designing clones of existing services etc.

## Share
Hope you find this book useful and share it with others.
