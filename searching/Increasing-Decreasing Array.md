# Increasing-Decreasing Array

Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing

## Algorithm
   * Use a binary search technique
   * At every step calculate the mid element
   * Compare the mid element with its neighbors
      * if they are increasing then search the right sub array,
      * if they are decreasing then search the left sub array
      * else we have found the max element

## Code
```

## Test cases

```

## Time complexity
Since we are using the binary search technique, its O(log n)
